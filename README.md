# Box-Breaker
 A 2D clicker game, created as part of a Live Creator Challenge for my Mastered bootcamp
 
 

-- THE CHALLENGE --

Given a brief to create a Leaderborad for a mini-game, participants had a day to complete the challenge

-- FINAL OUTCOME --

Whilst the final piece I produced didn't fully meet the brief of having a leaderboard linked with the mini-game, I enjoyed the learning experience that was the overall aim of the challenge.
